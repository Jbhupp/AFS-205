                    Hello fellow creators! My name is Jenni. A few years back I started working in a side business of creating and designing apparel. I have discovered that I love to create and design the images that go onto the apparel. I have always loved working on a computer and have been fascinated with designs that are used on clothing and actually the design of a web site. I have a variety of hobbies that I enjoy that range from sports to dirt track racing and truck pulling.  I have learnt that life is short so make the best of it and live life to its fullest.
